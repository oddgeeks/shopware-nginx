# Nginx configuration for running Shopware

This is an example configuration from running [Shopware](https://github.com/shopware/shopware) using
[nginx](http://nginx.org). Which is a high-performance non-blocking HTTP server.

This configuration is heavily inspired by [perusio's](https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx/) drupal-configuration.
